# Locations

Locations are geographic features on a layer which can be interacted with. An optional query ID \(qID\) field must be set in the layer definition in order to select locations. **Only MVT, Cluster, and GeoJSON layer can have locations.**

An infoJ field array describes the location properties and whether these can be [**edited**](../../workspaces/editing/).

The infoJ is used to query as well as calculate property values from the XYZ backend.

infoJ entries and their values are presented in the info panel of a location.
