We use [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) to test browser compliance of the client application. BrowserStack allows us to test older versions of Chrome as well as Microsoft Edge locally on non Windows development machines.

We do not currently use a JavaScript test suit but plan to integrate unit tests prior to a first point release.
